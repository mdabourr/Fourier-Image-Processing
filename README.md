# Fourier-Based Image Processing using MATLAB
Frequency-domain image processing using Fourier Transform in MATLAB.

## Overview
This project demonstrates image processing techniques in the frequency domain using the Fourier Transform in MATLAB.

The project applies FFT-based filtering to analyze image frequencies, visualize the Fourier spectrum, and reconstruct filtered images using low-pass and high-pass filters.

## Processing Pipeline

### 1. Load Image
The input image is loaded and converted into grayscale format for frequency-domain processing.

### 2. Fourier Transform
The image is transformed from the spatial domain into the frequency domain using:

```matlab
fft2()
```

### 3. Frequency Shift
Low-frequency components are shifted to the center using:

```matlab
fftshift()
```

### 4. Frequency Filtering
Circular masks are used to separate:
- Low-frequency components
- High-frequency components

### 5. Image Reconstruction
The filtered frequencies are transformed back into spatial-domain images using:

```matlab
ifft2()
```
